First make sure you have Node installed.

On Mac OS X, it's recommended to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Node + [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

    brew install node

To install the Node dependencies:

    npm install


### Local Development

To serve the site from a simple Node development server:

    npm start

Then launch the site from your favourite browser:

[__http://localhost:3000/__](http://localhost:3000/)

If you wish to serve the site from a different port:

    PORT=8000 npm start


### Deploy to Github Pages

Make sure you have committed all changes to master branch. Then run:
